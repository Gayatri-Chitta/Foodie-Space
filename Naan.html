            <li><b>Step To Make:</b></li>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Mix instant yeast with warm water and sugar -</b> is not a typical step you see in bread-making when using instant yeast. Usually the whole point of instant yeast is that you can add it straight into dough without mixing with warm water and letting it foam first.But, for naan, we found that blooming instant yeast in a warm water and sugar mixture (ie. letting it sit until it goes foamy) makes the naan fluffier and softer. It’s also an excellent safety test to ensure your yeast is still alive – nothing worse than discovering your yeast is dead once your bread is in the oven!</li><br>
                <li><b>Leave until foamy - </b> the mixture for 10 minutes until it becomes foamy, which means the yeast is alive and kicking. The warm water “wakes up” the yeast and the sugar helps too because yeast “eats” sugar to do its thing;</li><br>
                <li><b>Mix dry and wet ingredients –</b> In a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt), then add the foamy yeast, butter / ghee, and the milk + eggs;</li><br>
                <li><b>Mix –</b> Start by mixing with a firm rubber spatula or a wooden spoon to bring the dough together. We use spoons for no reason other than saving a sticky mess on your hands!</li><br>
                <li><b>Bring together by hand –</b> Once the mixture is too stiff to practically mix with a spatula, switch to hands. You don’t need to knead the dough, just mix it with your hands to bring it together into a cohesive dough;</li><br>
                <li><b>The dough –</b> Once the dough comes together, it should be sticky and soft enough to easily come together into a ball. But it should not be so sticky that the dough sticks to your hands – see picture above for right texture. If the dough is too sticky, sprinkle over a little flour and work that in;</li><br>
                <li><b>Proof dough –</b> Once the butter / ghee is incorporated, shape dough into a ball. Cover with cling-wrap then put the bowl somewhere warm to let it proof – about 1 – 1.5 hours, until it has doubled in volume;</li><br>
                <li><b>Doubled in volume –</b> The dough pictured above is after proofing for 1 1/2 hours. It has actually more than doubled because it was a very (no really, a very!) hot day. It’s ok if it more than doubles – mine is probably closer to triple. But if the dough rises way too much (as in even more than triple), then the yeast can run out of oomph and not rise properly when cooked. Try to limit proofing to doubling in size!</li><br>
                <li><b>Cut into six pieces –</b> Lift the dough out of the bowl on to a lightly floured surface. Cut into 6 equal pieces. This makes ~15 – 16 cm / 6 – 6.5″ diameter naans which are a nice individual serving size and comfortably cooked in a skillet;</li><br>
                <li><b>Shape into balls –</b> Make the top surface smooth by tucking the dough surface to the base;</li><br>
                <li><b>Rise 15 minutes, 50% increase in size –</b> Place the balls on a lightly floured tray, and cover loosely with a a lightweight tea towel (ie just place it on top, don’t tuck it tightly under the tray). Leave to rise in a warm place for 15 minutes until they increase in size by about 50%. It doesn’t take long;</li><br>
                <li><b>After rising –</b> Photo #12 is what they look like after 15 minutes. Ready to roll out and cook!</li><br>
                <li><b>Flatten on lightly floured surface –</b> Pick up a piece and flat it down lightly on a lightly floured surface;</li><br>
                <li><b>Roll out into  3 –</b> 4mm / 0.12 – 0.16″ thick rounds (about 16cm / 6.5″ wide). The thickness really affects the outcome. Too thin = crispier and not fluffy enough. Too thick and you won’t get the bubbles. We want the best of both worlds, ie. it should bubble up when cooked, be soft and fluffy inside and the naan itself should be floppy, not stiff.  3 – 4mm / 0.12 – 0.16″ thick is the perfect thickness – so pull out that ruler!</li><br>
                <li><b>Hot skillet –</b> Heat a well-seasoned* cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until it is just starting to smoke. Then place the naan in and leave to cook without touching. If you’re like me, you’ll get a kick out of watching the surface blister up and go all bubbly – it’s an extremely satisfying moment!</li><br>
                <li><b>60 to 90 seconds cooking, then flip –</b> It should only take 60 – 90 seconds for the underside to cook until it’s nicely browned. Then use tongs to turn;
