            <li><b>Step To Make:</b></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the Patty Mixture:</li><ul>
                    <li>In a large bowl, mix the ground meat with finely chopped onion, minced garlic, egg, breadcrumbs (if using), salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, and paprika.</li>
                    <li>Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly combined.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Form the Patties:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Divide the mixture into equal portions (usually about 4 patties for a 500g mix).</li>
                    <li>Shape each portion into a round, flat patty, about 1/2 inch thick. Press slightly in the center of each patty to prevent them from puffing up while cooking.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Cook the Patties:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat a grill, grill pan, or skillet over medium-high heat. Lightly oil the cooking surface.</li>
                    <li>Cook the patties for about 4-5 minutes on each side for medium doneness, or longer if you prefer them well done. If using cheese, place a slice on each patty during the last minute of cooking to let it melt.</li>
                    <li>Ensure the internal temperature reaches 160째F (71째C) for beef or 165째F (74째C) for chicken or turkey.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Toast the Buns:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>While the patties are cooking, lightly butter the burger buns and toast them on the grill or in a pan until golden brown.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Assemble the Burger:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spread ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise on the bottom half of each bun.</li>
                    <li>Place the cooked patty on top of the sauce.</li>
                    <li>Add lettuce, tomato slices, onion rings, and pickles as desired.</li>
                    <li>Cover with the top half of the bun.</li>   
                </ul>
                <li>Serve:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Serve the burgers hot with your favorite side dishes like fries, coleslaw, or a salad.</li>
                </ul>
