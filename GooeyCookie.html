            <li><b>Step 1</b></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5..</li>
                <li>Beat the butter, sugars and egg until smooth, then mix in the flour, chocolates and cherry pieces and ½ tsp salt.</li>
                <li>Spoon onto non-stick baking sheets in large rough blobs – you’ll get 20 out of this mix.</li>
                <li> Make sure they are well spaced as the cookies grow substantially as they bake.</li>  
            </ol>
            <li><b>Step 2</b></li>
            <ol>
                <li> Bake for 12-14 mins until just golden, but still quite pale and soft in the middle.</li>
                <li>If baking from frozen, give them a few mins more. </li>
                <li> Cool on the sheets for 5 mins, then lift onto racks with a fish slice and leave to cool completely.</li>   
            </ol>
