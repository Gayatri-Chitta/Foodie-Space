                    <p>Chicken Dum Biryani is a classic Indian dish that originates from the Mughlai cuisine. It’s a flavorful, aromatic, and rich one-pot meal where marinated chicken is cooked with fragrant basmati rice, herbs, and spices, all sealed together in a ‘dum’ (slow cooking) process to let the flavors meld beautifully.</p>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                    <li>The first step is to take cut chicken pieces, wash them well and drain excess water out. Then add salt, red chili powder, turmeric powder, ginger garlic paste, whole spices such as cardamom powder, cinnamon, cloves, shahi jeera, garam masala powder.</li>
                <li>Add Yogurt and green chilli paste. Take some green chillies, few cilantro leaves, add a pinch of salt and make a fine paste. Add green chili paste as per spice requirement.</li>
                <li>Mix everything well.</li>
                <li>Add crushed fried onions</li>
                <li>Add black peppercorn powder, mint leaves, coriander leaves, oil, lemon extract.</li>

                <li>Place a Tawa. Place a cooking pot on the Tawa. Placing a griddle below the cooking pot avoids burning the biryani at the base. Add little oil at the base, add the marinated chicken, spread evenly.</li>
